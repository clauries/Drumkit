#### [Deployed App](#)

## Concept
As a non-drumming musician, I want to be able to quickly drum out a beat so that I can communicate what I want in a song to a drummer.

## Usage
1. Download or clone code.
2. Open html in your favorite browser.
3. Make sure your sound is on.
4. Upon keystrokes (a, s, d, f, g, h, j, k, l), percussion sounds will be emitted.
5. Enjoy making sick beats. 


## Tech Utilized
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
